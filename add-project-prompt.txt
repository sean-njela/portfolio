You are an expert technical writer. I need to add a project card to my portfolio CMS (Sanity). Please help me generate the content based on this structure.

Here is the information about the project (example):

- Project Name: Argo CD Production Demo
- GitHub Repository URL: https://github.com/sean-njela/argocd-demo
- Live Documentation or Demo Link: https://sean-njela.github.io/argocd-demo/
- Category: DevOps
- Technologies Used: Argo CD, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions
- Date Created: 2025-07-27 (yyyy-mm-dd)

Using this, generate the following:

1. **Name** – Use the provided name.
2. **Image Alt Text** – A short, descriptive alt text (8–15 words) for an image of the project.
3. **Description** – A compelling and concise project description (3–5 sentences). Include what the project does, the purpose, technologies used, and any standout features.
4. **Repository** – Use the provided GitHub repo link.
5. **Live Link** – Use the GitHub Pages link.
6. **Category** – As provided.
7. **Technologies** – Just list them.
8. **Created At** – Use the provided date.

Make sure the description is clear, engaging, and suitable for a portfolio aimed at developers and potential clients/employers.
